            <h3>About Us</h3>
            <p>Welcome to Aarav's Kitchen, where passion meets flavor. Founded in 2023 by Aarav Sambyal, our restaurant
                was born from a dream to bring people together through exceptional food, warm hospitality, and
                unforgettable experiences.</p>
            <p>Aarav's Kitchen began their culinary journey with a simple belief — that great food has the power to
                connect hearts. After years of honing their craft in kitchens across Jammu, they decided to create a
                place that reflects both tradition and innovation. Every dish on our menu tells a story — inspired by
                family recipes, global influences, and a deep respect for quality ingredients.</p>

            <p>Since opening our doors, it has become a local favorite and a destination for food lovers seeking
                authentic flavors served with a modern touch. Our commitment to excellence has earned us “Best New
                Restaurant 2023” featured in local magazines and, most importantly, the loyalty of our guests.</p>

            <p>At Aarav's Kitchen, we believe dining is more than a meal — its an experience. From our inviting
                atmosphere to our dedicated team, every detail is designed to make you feel at home. Whether you are
                joining us for a quick lunch, a family celebration, or a romantic dinner, we are honored to share our
                table with you.</p>

            <p>Come taste our story — one plate at a time.</p>
